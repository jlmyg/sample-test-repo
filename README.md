# sample-test-repo

### This is my repository to showcase what I know when it comes to test automation. This repo focuses on using tools such as Selenium, Python, and Pytest.


### First steps to run this test repository: install python
    1. Install python through https://www.python.org/


### Additionally, you can also install python through pyenv which helps manage your python version in the long run. You can check it through https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file

### TODO: Add docker capabilities for running the tests
